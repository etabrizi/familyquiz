A react quiz app to be used as a screen share on zoom calls. 

Uses a number of static objects to load videos and images into a component. 

For instance this src link uses a embeded youtube video link  - 

  "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qd04u2Yj44?autoplay=1&start=50&end=70&rel=0"

  start=50  - Start time of the video clip
  end=70 - End time of the video clip
  rel=0 - Removes promo thumbnails from the end of each clip

Images need to be relative to the public/images folder, for example - 

"src": "../images/mercury.jpeg"

Customise the quiz to however you want it to run, this one is for films, space, 80s music and flags. Enjoy. ;)
